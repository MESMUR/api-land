# API Land

## Introduction

Welcome to API Land! A personal project of mine where I piece together a production-ready backend
API gateway from scratch. This is an exercise as a backend developer to improve on my ability to
build a production grade backend, using state of the art technology, as well as setting up and
managing relevant infrastructure such as containers, CI/CD, tests, authorization, and other
infrastructure I come across ;)
